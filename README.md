# The_Dungeoneers
Project: Levi's Fungeon
Requirements:
Unity to run current in-development releases
Description:
Leviâ€™s Fungeon is a dungeon crawling roguelike, where the player controls a party of 4 characters descending into a dungeon. The party will move through premade rooms in a random order, occasionally coming across a shop or boss room. They can spend the gold they acquire defeating monsters that randomly appear in the rooms to acquire gear (though they can also find gear by defeating monsters) at a shop as well as acquire xp that can be spent before the start of a new runthrough to acquire new skills and permanent upgrades. After a boss room the party enters a new floor where rewards are increased but the enemies are more difficult to defeat. Once the party is defeated or defeats the final boss they are sent back to the hub zone to purchase upgrades before starting anew.
